        As a result of the importance of our sustainability and carbon reduction targets, knowing the amount of carbon emitted 
        by the vehicles we insure will be of great benefit to us in determining the premiums. So how do we get this information 
        using the CO2 emissions data already available at certain OEs? How can we match existing information with the vehicle 
        portfolio from other OEs? Or how can we evaluate the CO2 emission information of vehicles on a global scale?

        find out our findings.
